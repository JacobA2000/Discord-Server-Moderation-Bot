# Discord Server Moderation Bot
A bot to moderate discord servers, made in python using discord.py rewrite.

**TO RUN THIS BOT YOU WILL HAVE TO SET UP A BOT ACCOUNT FOR DISCORD WHICH YOU CAN DO HERE: https://discord.com/developers/applications**

**THE BOT WILL REQUIRE ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS**

When first run the bot will create a config.json file in its directory, **You will need to locate this file, open it and add your token to the file.** 
You will also be able to edit other things in this file such as the bots prefix, banned words and more.

Once you have added your token you will need to re-run the bot and aslong as everything is valid the bot will launch. 

**You can find a list of the commands by using the help command
which can be run by typing the prefix you set followed by help, for example if you haven't edited the prefix, the default command would be $help.**
